# Microsoft-Stock-Prediction-Using-LSTM
LSTM prediction of stock data for Microsoft. Year(2021 March to 2022 Matrch) 
There are two different files one is implemented on long term data set from 1986-03-18' to '2022-03-23 and the 
other being from '2021-03-25' to '2022-03-23'

The LSTM prediction is done for the next three days setting a target for present day and next three days. The prediction was accurate for short term dataset 
and was not good for long term dataset.

As seen in the above image the short term prediction is very accurate and results are satisfactory compared to long term dataset.
